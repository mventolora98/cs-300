# cs-300
The main issues I dealt with in CS 300 were managing, organizing, and optimizing data operations through the use of efficient data structures.  In order to effectively handle dynamic data, I specifically worked on implementing linked lists, binary search trees, and hash tables.  I started every project by examining the problem requirements, determining the kinds of operations required (such sorting, searching, and insertion), and choosing data structures that struck a compromise between memory efficiency and temporal complexity.  For instance, I gave binary search trees priority due to their O(log n) search times when quick searching was essential, while a linked list offered the required flexibility for more straightforward storage requirements.

I used a structured debugging method when I ran into obstacles, including segmentation faults brought on by improper pointer handling or difficulties balancing a binary search tree.  This involved researching best practices in C++ memory management and tree traversal methods, creating smaller test cases to isolate issues, then stepping through code execution line by line using gdb (GNU Debugger).  The secret to overcome these obstacles was perseverance and systematic problem-solving.

My knowledge of software design has greatly increased as a result of this project.  I've learned how crucial it is to select the right data structure based on real-world data circumstances in order to maximize performance as well as functionality.  Additionally, it reaffirmed the idea that code that is clear and modular enhances readability, maintainability, and the ease of future modifications.

All things considered, my coding techniques have changed to emphasize clear structure, thorough comments, significant variable name, and flexibility.  I now approach programming with a philosophy of scalability and future-proofing, making sure that programs are effective, modular, and simple to improve as project requirements increase in complexity, as opposed to developing solely for immediate utility.
